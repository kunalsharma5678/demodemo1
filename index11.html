Communication is the exchange of information through different mediums.
<p/>
<p>
It is an activity that started even before the civilization of human beings; however, over a period of time, as technology advanced, accordingly different modes of communications also developed including telecommunication and wireless communication.
<p/>
<p>
The main elements inherent to communication have been described[3] as:

The formation of communicative motivation or reason.
1: Message composition (further internal or technical elaboration on what exactly to express).
2: Message encoding (for example, into digital data, written text, speech, pictures, gestures and so on).
3: Transmission of the encoded message as a sequence of signals using a specific channel or medium.
4: Noise sources such as natural forces and in some cases human activity (both intentional and accidental) begin influencing the quality of signals propagating from the sender to one or more receivers.
5: Reception of signals and reassembling of the encoded message from a sequence of received signals.
6: Decoding of the reassembled encoded message.
7: Interpretation and making sense of the presumed original message.

Verbal communication
  It is the spoken or written conveyance of a message. Human language can be defined as a system of symbols (sometimes known as lexemes) and the grammars (rules) by which the symbols are manipulated. The word "language" also refers to common properties of languages. Language learning normally occurs most intensively during human childhood. Most of the large number of human languages use patterns of sound or gesture for symbols which enable communication with others around them.
